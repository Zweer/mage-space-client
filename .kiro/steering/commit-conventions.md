# Commit Conventions

**IMPORTANT**: The agent NEVER commits, pushes, or creates tags. The developer handles all git operations manually. At the end of each task, suggest a commit message.

## Format

Conventional commits with gitmoji as text codes (not emoji):

```
type(scope): :emoji_code: short description

Detailed explanation of what changed and why.
```

## Types

- `feat` — New feature (`:sparkles:`)
- `fix` — Bug fix (`:bug:`)
- `perf` — Performance improvement (`:zap:`)
- `docs` — Documentation (`:memo:`)
- `chore` — Maintenance tasks (`:wrench:`, `:arrow_up:`, `:bookmark:`)
- `refactor` — Code refactoring (`:recycle:`)
- `test` — Tests (`:white_check_mark:`)
- `style` — Code formatting (`:art:`)
- `ci` — CI/CD changes (`:construction_worker:`)
- `build` — Build system (`:hammer:`)

## Scope

Use the module or area affected:
- `client` — Main MageSpaceClient class
- `auth` — Firebase authentication (token refresh, session)
- `generation` — Image generation (submit, poll)
- `characters` — Character search/CRUD
- `history` — Generation history
- `actions` — Action hash discovery
- `rsc` — RSC response parser
- `http` — HTTP client internals
- `types` — Type definitions

Scope is optional for cross-cutting changes.

## Gitmoji

**Always use text codes** (`:sparkles:`), **never actual emoji** (✨).

## Body

**Always include a detailed body** explaining:
1. What was changed
2. Why it was changed
3. Any important context or side effects

## Examples

```
feat(auth): :sparkles: implement Firebase token refresh

Exchange refresh token for ID token via securetoken.googleapis.com.
Create session cookie via createUserSession server action.
Auto-refresh on token expiry with 5-minute buffer.
```

```
docs(api): :memo: document generation submit/poll flow

Reverse-engineered from mage.space via Playwright:
- POST /creations with next-action header for submit
- Poll getHistoryById until status != "running"
- RSC response format documented with parsing rules
```
